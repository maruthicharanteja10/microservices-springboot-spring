Spring Framework
Spring is a comprehensive framework for enterprise Java development. It provides a wide range of capabilities, including dependency injection, transaction management, and support for building web applications.

Key features:

Dependency Injection: Simplifies the creation and management of Java objects.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Supports separating cross-cutting concerns from business logic.
Data Access: Facilitates interaction with databases using JDBC, JPA, and other ORM frameworks.
Integration: Provides integration with various enterprise services like messaging and transaction management.

Spring Boot
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications. It provides a streamlined way to configure and run Spring applications with minimal boilerplate code.

Key features:

Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures your Spring application based on the dependencies you include.
Standalone Applications: Allows you to create standalone applications that can run without an external application server.
Production-Ready: Includes features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration to help you build production-ready applications.
Embedded Servers: Integrates with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, allowing for easy deployment.

Microservices Architecture
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. Each service is independently deployable and can be developed and scaled individually.

Key benefits:

Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its load and performance requirements.
Resilience: Failure in one microservice does not affect the others, enhancing the overall system's fault tolerance.
Technology Diversity: Different microservices can be built using different technologies best suited for their specific tasks.
Continuous Deployment: Facilitates faster and more frequent updates by allowing individual services to be deployed independently.
