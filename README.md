## Spring Framework
Spring is a comprehensive framework for enterprise Java development. It provides numerous features that help in building robust and maintainable applications.

### Key Concepts
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: A design pattern that allows the creation and management of dependencies outside the class.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: The principle where the control of objects is transferred from the application to a container or framework.
- **Spring Beans**: Objects that are instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container.
- **Spring Context**: The IoC container responsible for managing the lifecycle and configuration of beans.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: A programming paradigm that separates cross-cutting concerns from business logic.
- **Spring MVC**: A framework for building web applications following the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures data integrity and consistency in enterprise applications.

## Spring Boot
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the development of Spring applications.

### Key Features
- **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures your Spring application based on the dependencies you include.
- **Spring Boot Starters**: A set of convenient dependency descriptors to include necessary dependencies.
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Provides production-ready features like monitoring, metrics, and health checks.
- **Embedded Servers**: Allows running Spring applications standalone without requiring an external application server.
- **Spring Boot CLI**: A command-line tool to quickly prototype Spring applications.

## Microservices Architecture
Microservices architecture structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Key Concepts
- **Service Discovery**: Mechanism for microservices to discover each other dynamically at runtime.
- **API Gateway**: A server that acts as an API front-end, routing requests to appropriate microservices.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized management of configuration settings for microservices.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Mechanisms to handle failures gracefully, including Circuit Breaker, Retry, and Bulkhead patterns.
- **Service Orchestration and Choreography**: Strategies for managing interactions between microservices.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Tracking requests as they flow through microservices.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Microservices communicate through events.
- **Containerization**: Packaging microservices as lightweight, standalone containers.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices.
- **Security**: Ensuring microservices are secure with authentication, authorization, and encryption.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure, with each module corresponding to a specific microservice. Here is an example structure:

│
├── service-a
│   ├── src/main/java/com/example/servicea
│   ├── src/main/resources
│   └── pom.xml
│
